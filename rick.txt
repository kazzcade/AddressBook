Would like to have done more before submitting, but time available has been a little more limited lately. 
Considering such, did want to push up changes to show some of the work done. 
Biggest changes/additions are:
1. Fetch API
2. Case insensitive search
3. Search database by first and last name.
4. Rendering of message to user when no matches are found in database. 

I did look over all the points from review, and have a better sense of the mindset that I'd like to establish as I continue to grow. 
Thanks again for taking the time to review.
